# Modelling Hyperglycemia in Patients with Monogenic Forms of Diabetes
This is a poster done in my first year of my Mathematics degree for my MATH40008 Individual Research Project module. Based on Topp et al.'s βIG Model, which provides a model for the relationship between pancreatic β-cell mass, blood insulin concentration, and blood glucose concentration, I investigated the pathway to hyperglycemia in a person subjected to abnormal conditions (simplistic interpretations of genetically caused diabetes). I achieved a 90% mark for this project, which included an oral presentation aspect. My poster is to be put on display for prospective undergraduate students looking to study at Imperial College London on open days during the 2023-2024 academic year.
