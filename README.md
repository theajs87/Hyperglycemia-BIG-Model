# Hyperglycemia-BIG-Model
This is a poster done in my first year of my Mathematics degree for my MATH40007 Individual Research Project module. Based on Topp et al.'s βIG Model, which provides a model for the relationship between pancreatic β-cell mass, blood insulin concentration, and blood glucose concentration, I investigated the pathway to hyperglycemia in a person subjected to abnormal conditions (simplistic interpretations of genetically caused diabetes). I was given a 90% mark for this project, which included an oral presentation aspect.
